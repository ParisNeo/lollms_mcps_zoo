## Overview

**YouTube_Transcript_MCP** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the [lollms](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms) ecosystem. It provides a simple but powerful tool for Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve the full text transcript of any YouTube video, effectively allowing the LLM to "read" its content.

This enables a wide range of applications, such as summarizing educational videos, answering specific questions about a product review, or analyzing the content of a talk without needing to process audio or video directly.

## Features

-   **Simple Video Access:** Fetches transcripts using only the standard YouTube video ID.
-   **Multi-language Support:** Allows specifying a language code to get transcripts in different languages, if available.
-   **Structured Output:** Returns a clean JSON object with the status and the full transcript text, making it easy for an LLM to use.
-   **Self-Sufficient:** Automatically installs the `youtube-transcript-api` library and other dependencies on first run using `pipmaster`.
-   **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear error messages if transcripts are disabled or not found for a specific language.

---

## Configuration

This MCP requires no configuration and is ready to use immediately after startup.

---

## Usage

1.  **Start the MCP server**  
    The script will handle dependency installation and then launch the server.
    ```bash
    python youtube_transcript_mcp.py
    ```

2.  **Interact via lollms**  
    The MCP exposes the `get_youtube_transcript` tool. An LLM can call this tool with a video ID to get its content.

    -   **Basic usage (defaulting to English):**  
        `{"tool": "get_youtube_transcript", "video_id": "M-O9S3_2p6A"}`

    -   **Specifying a language:**  
        `{"tool": "get_youtube_transcript", "video_id": "M-O9S3_2p6A", "language_code": "es"}`

## Disclaimer

-   This tool's success is dependent on the availability of transcripts for the requested YouTube video. Many videos, especially older or less popular ones, may not have them.
-   Transcripts can be either manually created or auto-generated by YouTube. Auto-generated transcripts may contain inaccuracies.
-   This tool is a client for YouTube's data and is subject to their terms of service.
