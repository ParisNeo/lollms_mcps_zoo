  description: A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing a suite of symbolic mathematics tools for LLMs. Powered by the SymPy library, it enables exact computations in algebra and calculus, such as solving equations, simplifying expressions, differentiation, and integration.
  disclaimer: This tool performs symbolic computations, which can be computationally intensive. Very complex expressions may lead to long processing times. The parsing of expressions assumes standard mathematical notation.
