description: A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a secure, advanced calculator for Large Language Models (LLMs). It can evaluate complex mathematical expressions, including functions and constants, using a sandboxed interpreter to prevent dangerous code execution.
disclaimer: This tool uses a secure expression evaluator ('asteval') and is much safer than using Python's built-in eval(). However, extremely complex or deeply nested expressions could still consume significant resources. Use with reasonably scoped mathematical queries.
